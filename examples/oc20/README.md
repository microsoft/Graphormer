# Open Catalyst Challenge


<img src="ocp.gif" width=70%> 

The Open Catalyst Project is a collaborative research effort between Facebook AI Research (FAIR) and Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s (CMU) Department of Chemical Engineering. The aim is to use AI to model and discover new catalysts for use in renewable energy storage to help in addressing climate change.

The detailed description of this dataset could be found in [here](https://opencatalystproject.org/).



### Example Usage

Data Preparation: Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Open-Catalyst-Project/ocp/blob/master/DATASET.md) to prepare your OC20 dataset.

To train a Graphormer-3D for IS2RE direct task:

```bash oc20.sh```
